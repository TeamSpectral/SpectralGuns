    +added mod logo
    *fixed formatting errors
    +added url to pmc page
    *mod name changed from "Spectral Guns" to "SpectralGuns"
+added dynamic durability for each component
    •each component has its own separate durability
    •each material has a different durability mod
    •so does each component variant
    •when one parts durability is depleted, the component will be destroyed and the gun drops all its remaining parts
    •durability on each component is kept when gun is disassembled
    •parts can be repaired in an anvil using the correct material
+added temperature system
    •each component has its own temperature
    •temperature spreads dynamically from component to component
    •some temperature is lost over time
    •different materials conduct heat differently
    •each material has both a minimum and maximum threshold:
        •too high temperatures will damage the gun
        •too low temperatures will also damage the gun
        •red outline around camera to indicate the gun taking temperature-damage
    •very high temperatures on the handle will hurt the user, and possibly set them on fire if temperature is extremely high
+added list of components on the hud to the right
    •displays temperature in a blue-grey-red spectrum
*magazines give off heat when firing, some more than others
*completely rewrote the system for storing components in nbt-data to hold more than one of the same component:
    •pre 1.3 guns should be automatically converted to the new system
+added addon component type:
    •you can have up to four of them (there are four slots)
    •effects stack on top of each other
    •generally not in different tiers
+added the overclocker:
    •fits in the addon slots
    •use up to four at the same time
    •increases fire-rate
        •fully automatic guns have slightly higher fire-rate
    •increases projectile velocity
    •increases recoil
    •increases kickback
    •increases instability
    •produces lots of heat upon firing
+added informative error messages in the gun table
*improved algorithm for shift clicking items into the gun table
+added completely new ammunition that give more than one shot, as well as different tiers of ammunition
    •snowball containers of two different sizes
    •food containers
    •fireball bolt ammo
*recoil is stored in the player's data, not separately in the gun itemstacks
*gun projectiles ignore the temporary invulnerability on entities right after they take damage
    •the damage of multiple projectiles hitting the same entity at the same time will now stack *THIS IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE!*
+added shaky camera effect when aiming
    •higher if instability is higher
    •higher the further in you're zooming
+added render of the current projectile in the hud
+added field for naming guns in the gun assembly table
*player model aims, as if firing a bow, when holding the gun
+added lots more information in the gun tooltip and the tooltip of components
    •on the gun tooltip: hold shift to show/hide all the components
+added ability to adjust how much you want to zoom when using a scope, by using the scroll wheel
-completely removed material incompatibility
+added material traits, as a replacement for material incompatibilities:
    •burning (wood):
        •component takes more damage from overheating
        •chance of setting on user on fire from overheating
    •rusts (iron):
        •slowly looses durability in water and rain
    •shatters (diamond):
        •when on low durability, chance of taking even more damage each time component is damaged
    •shiny (gold and diamond):
        •takes extra damage when firing with a food magazine
*fireball guns will fire all the different projectiles in one equal direction
+added interaction with dynious' version checker mod (http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2091981)
    •this may not work yet
*changed a lot about how damage works (this will be tweaked later! don't worry!)
    •damage depends on mass and velocity
+added some achievements
+spectral taco
-WOBBLE

and of course:

*lots of balancing, nerfs and tweaks:
    •tweaked gun model's rotation and such to look like it's being held like an actual gun
    •made the fireball magazine's fire-rate 3x slower
    •fireballs deal 2 fire damage and 6 standard projectile damage
    •decreased recoil instability when using iron-sights or a scope
    •only smooth camera when aiming with a scope, not with iron-sights
    •the wider the barrel, the more projectiles for the snowball and food/puker magazines
    •increased fireball velocity
    •heavily decreased food velocity
    •slightly decreased snowball velocity
*lots of bug fixes:
    •stacks of components in the gun table no longer magically disappear
    •fixed ghost clientside firing
    •prevented recoil from trying to launch camera rotation off screen
    •projectiles render from further away now
    •key input is not sent when you're in a gui
